# Shopping Cart

## How do I use the Shopping Cart’s feature?

Click “Add to Cart” at the Product/ Service details page after performing a Search at the Homepage, and the Product/ Service will be added into the Shopping Cart.

## What is the next step to do after I added the Products/ Services into the shopping cart?

After the Products/ Services had been added into the Shopping Cart, you will be at Step 1 - Cart Order. There are 2 more steps to complete your transaction.

1.	At Step 2 - Order Summary, enter Delivery Information, Remarks, Payment Method and click “Confirm Order”

2.	At Step 3 - Order Number will be generated after Order Submission is successful. You may click “Order Management” to track this order.

## Why do the Products/ Services that I put into the shopping cart need the Supplier to verify the Tax, Delivery Fee and Additional costs again?

As your order might involve additional charges like Tax, Delivery Fee and other Additional Costs hence the Supplier will need to verify and include these costs into your order as the final billable amount.
