# Public RFQs/ Quotation

##  What are Public RFQs? How to search for Public RFQs?

Public RFQs (Request for Quotation) are the Buyers’ open Request for Quotation which are open to all qualified Suppliers requesting for the Quotations to be send back to them.

To search for Public RFQs, go to MOL’s homepage > Current Orders section > Select the platform’s tab, E.g. Ship Supply > Filter by Port and other required filters and click Search > Find the order > Quote Now

##  Why are there some RFQs that I cannot quote?

There are two reasons why you are unable to quote some RFQs;

Firstly, it will be based on your company registration’s Business Type and Ports Coverage. You will only be able to quote the RFQs based on these two criteria. For example, if your Business Type belongs to “Port Agency” and Port Coverage is “Singapore”, then you will only be able to quote the RFQs based these two criteria and not other types of RFQs that do not belong to these two criteria.

Secondly, the Buyers will be able to select their preferred Suppliers to send the RFQs. If you are not selected by the Buyers as their preferred Suppliers, then you will not be able to quote the RFQs.

##  Can I set the validity period in the Quotation?

Yes. It can be set under the Quotation Validity section in the Quotation form. There are two options:

Quotation Validity 

-	Enter “days”, “hours” and “minutes”
