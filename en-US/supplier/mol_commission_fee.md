# MOL’s Commission Fee

##  What is MOL’s Commission Fee?

MOL introduces the mature e-commerce model into the maritime industry. Suppliers are able to open their online stores to display their companies’ information, products and services for the convenience of the Buyers (primarily Shipowners) to search for the products/ services and place orders.

On the other hand, MOL strives to encourage the global Buyers (Shipowners) to send their RFQs online and supported by the qualified Suppliers who send the Quotations back to them. This in turn aids the Suppliers in getting new buyers and opening up new sales channels/ markets. After the Suppliers obtained the appointed orders in the system, MOL will require the Suppliers to pay a commission fee based on the successful transaction’s amount in supporting the MOL’s platform operations. MOL follows the principle of “No Transaction No Payment”, Suppliers may use the platform’s functions and MOL will only collect the commission fee from the Supplier upon successful appointed orders in the platform. 

##  What are MOL’s Commission Fee Charges Rates and Policy?

Depending on the nature of the business for each platform, MOL will charge the commission fee differently for each platform. For more information, please click [here](http://emarineonline.com) to view the commission fees and the transaction terms and conditions for each platform.

##  When the Commission Fee is due after a transaction was completed in MOL, how do I make payment for it?

MOL will collect the commission fee on a monthly basis from the Suppliers; a digital invoice will be send to your registered email address and you will need to make payment via Telegraphic Transfer (TT) or Cheque payment modes within 14 days after the digital invoice had been sent.

##  What is considered as a successful transaction between the Supplier and Buyer in MOL’s platform?

After the Supplier had sent the Quotation based on the RFQ (Request For Quotation) back to the Buyer, and the Quotation had been “Appointed” by the Buyer, this is considered as a transaction being transacted successfully in MOL’s platform. As a Supplier, you will need to pay a commission fee for the successful transaction based on the amount displayed in the Quotation.

##  Although I was appointed by the Buyer, but the order did not transact successfully in the end, do I still need to pay for the MOL’s Commission Fee?

For some special circumstances, if the Supplier’s Quotation had been “Appointed” by the Buyer but was unable to complete the transaction successfully, the Supplier will need to submit the supporting evidences/ documents etc. to prove that the transaction was unsuccessful between you and the Buyer at the MOL’s platform. MOL will review the supporting evidences/ documents etc. submitted, and only after verification, will exempt the commission fee from the Supplier. If there are no supporting evidences/ documents etc. to prove that the transaction was unsuccessful in MOL’s platform, MOL will still define this as a successful transaction and the Supplier will still need to pay a commission fee to MOL.
